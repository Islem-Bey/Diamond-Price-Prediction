# Diamond-Price-Prediction

## Abstract

Diamond is one of the strongest and the most valuable substances produced naturally as a form of carbon. However, unlike gold and silver, determining the price of a diamond is very complex because many features are to be considered for determining its price. This project aims to come up with the most efficient algorithm for the price prediction of diamonds. The algorithms such as Linear regression, XGBoost regressor, Decision trees, Random Forest regression and K-Neighbors regression are used to train the particular machine learning models on the diamond dataset for the prediction of diamond prices based on various attributes. The comparative analysis of various Machine Learning Regression models is done for the price prediction of any diamond.
